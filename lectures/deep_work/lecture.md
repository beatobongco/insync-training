# Deep Work:
_Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World_

by Cal Newport



# Part 1: The Idea



## What is Deep Work?
Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.



## Bill Gates
Twice-a-year "Think Weeks" during which he would isolate himself (often in a lakeside cottage) to do nothing but read and think big thoughts.


## Neal Stephenson:
```If I organize my life in such a way that I get lots of long, consecutive, uninterrupted time-chunks, I can write novels. [If instead I get interrupted a lot] what replaces it? Instead of a novel that will be around for a long time... there is a bunch of e-mail messages that I have sent out to individual persons.```


## Carl Jung
Built a two-story retreat house/office in Bollingen, away from his lectures and counseling practice in Zurich.


## Mark Twain
Wrote _The Adventures of Tom Sawyer_ in a shed on the property of the Quarry Farm in New York.

His study was so isolated from the main house that his family took to blowing a horn to attract his attention for meals!



## The Main Point
The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly _rare_ at exactly the same time it is becoming increasing _valuable_ in our economy.

As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.



# Deep Work is Important



## The new economy
* Rise of digital technology and intelligent machines
* "Our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind." - Brynjolfsson and McAfee, _Race Against the Machine_, 2011


## There are two core abilities for thriving in the new economy:


## 1. The ability to quickly learn hard things.
* Intelligent machines are complicated and hard to master.
* If you can't learn, you can't thrive.


## 2. The ability to produce at an elite level.
 * Mastering skills is necessary but not sufficient -- you must then transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value.
 * If you don't produce, you won't thrive.



## Deep work helps you quickly learn hard things.


## Deliberate practice
"We deny that these differences [between expert performers and normal adults] are immutable... Instead, we argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain."

(Prof. K. Anders Ericsson on deliberate practice, 1990)


## Deliberate practice
Requires 1) tight focus on the specific skill and 2) receiving feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it's most productive.


## Deliberate practice and myelination
In _The Talent Code_ (2009), Daniel Coyle explores neurological basis of talent and many scientists agree myelination is a part of it.


## Myelination
* Myelin is a layer of fatty tissue that grows around neurons, acting like an insulator that allows the cells to fire faster and cleaner.
* Myelination improves a particular neural circuit (corresponding for example to a certain movement, a certain particular application of skill...).


## Developing myelin
* Do deep practice, at the edge of your current skill. Make mistakes, pay attention, correct those mistakes, over and over.
* Great teachers and coaches help this process by offering highly specific, targeted feedback while students are doing deep practice.
* Myelination provides a foundation for why deliberate practice works!



## Deep work helps you produce at an elite level.


## Deep work and productivity
* High performers don't necessarily work more hours -- they just work more efficiently.
* Focusing and avoiding distraction prevents task-switching _attention residue_ (moving to next task while still thinking about previous task).


## Deep work and productivity
To produce at your peak level you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction.

**The type of work that optimizes your performance is deep work.**



# Deep Work is Rare


## Modern trends
* Serendipitous collaboration (e.g., open-plan offices)
* Rapid communication, always-available connectivity
* Active presence on social media


While they have benefits, these trends actively _decrease_ one's ability to go deep!

They are constant and powerful sources of distraction and interruption.



## Why are distractions embraced in the workplace?


## Culture of connectivity:
* One is expected to read and respond to emails (and related communication) quickly.
* May seem necessary, but in one test study, **forcing team members to take one workday completely off from connectivity** led to:
  * more enjoyment in their work,
  * better communication among themselves,
  * more learning, and
  * "a better product delivered to the client."


## Principle of least resistance
* It's easier (in the moment) to get an immediate response instead of planning in advance and being more organized (even if it's better in the long run).
* It becomes acceptable to run your day out of your inbox and still _feel_ productive.


## Basically: deep work is hard, shallow work is easier.



# Deep Work is Meaningful



## A deep life is not just lucrative, but also a life well lived.



## Neurological argument for depth
* Winifred Gallagher dealt with getting diagnosed with cancer by focusing on her life, instead of allowing the disease to monopolize her attention.
* It worked surprisingly well and she set out to better understand the connection between attention and quality of life.


## Gallagher's theory
She summarizes it after five years of science reporting:

“The skillful management of attention is the _sine qua non_ of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.”
“Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love -- is the sum of what you focus on.”

(Winifred Gallagher, science writer, author of _Rapt_)


## Gallagher's theory
* Our brains construct our worldview based on _what we pay attention to_.
* If you focus on the cancer diagnosis, you and your life become unhappy and dark, but if you focus instead on an evening martini, you and your life become more pleasant -- even though the circumstances in both scenarios are the same.


## Deep work and meaning
There’s a gravity and sense of importance inherent in deep work.

So Gallagher's theory predicts that if you spend enough time in this state, your mind will understand your world as rich in meaning and importance.



## Deep work and avoiding shallowness
Rapt attention and deep work also have a hidden benefit:

Such concentration hijacks your attention apparatus, preventing you from noticing the many smaller and less pleasant things that unavoidably and persistently populate our lives.



## Psychological argument for depth
* Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (experimental psychologist) and the mental state of _flow_: "The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile."
* Similar to Gallagher, but in this theory, the feeling of going deep _in itself_ is very rewarding, regardless of content.


## Deep work, _flow_, and happiness
Deep work is an activity well suited to generate a flow state, and flow generates happiness!

So, to build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work is a proven path to deep satisfaction.



## Philosophical argument for depth
In their 2011 book _All Things Shining_, Dreyfus and Kelly lament that:

"The world used to be, in its various forms, a world of sacred, shining things. The shining things now seem far away."


## Descartes, skepticism, and the Enlightenment
* Descartes: The individual seeking certainty trumps a God or a king bestowing truth.
* In a post-Enlightenment world, we have tasked _ourselves_ to identify what's meaningful and what's not.
* This can seem an arbitrary exercise and introduce nihilism.


## Craftsmanship

Dreyfus and Kelly argue that craftsmanship provides a key to reopening a sense of sacredness in a responsible manner.

"The task of a craftsman is not to _generate_ meaning, but rather to _cultivate_ in himself the skill of _discerning_ the meanings that are _already_ there."


"Beautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give that code to another programmer they would say, 'oh, that's well written code.' It's much like as if you were writing a poem."


"Within the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and craftsmanship... One hundred years from now, our engineering may seem as archaic as the techniques used by medieval cathedral builders seem to today's civil engineers, while our craftsmanship will still be honored."

(From _Pragmatic Programmer_)


Your work is craft, and if you hone your ability and apply it with respect and care, then like the skilled wheelwright who finds meaning in the act of shaping wood into a wheel, you can generate meaning in the daily efforts of your professional life.



# Part 2: The Rules



## Rule #1: Work deeply



* Deep work is not easy, we fight distractions and desires all day long.
* Willpower is finite and is like a muscle that gets tired, so we use _routines_ and _rituals_ to minimize the amount of willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration.



## The rhythmic approach to depth
* _Rhythmic_ scheduling: transform deep work sessions into a simple regular habit.
* Seinfeld's _chain method_: every day you do something, mark it with an X on a calendar. Keep at it, and your only job is not to break that chain.
* Alternatively, just start and do a deep work session at the same time everyday.



## Ritualize
"...the single best piece of advice I can offer to anyone trying to do creative work is to ignore inspiration."

(Mason Currey, journalist who cataloged habits of famous thinkers and writers)

"[Great creative minds] think like artists but work like accountants."

(David Brooks, _New York Times_)


While there's no one _correct_ deep work ritual, consider the following:


## Where you'll work and for how long
* Find a deep work retreat, if possible.
* Give yourself a specific time frame to keep the session a discrete challenge and not an open-ended slog.


## How you'll work once you start to work
* Rules and processes to keep your efforts structured
* Examples:
  * Ban internet use
  * Maintain a metric to track your progress


## How you'll support your work
How will you keep yourself in the best condition to work? Some ideas:
* A cup of good coffee to start
* Access to food to keep your energy up
* Integrate walks
* Keep your materials and equipment organized



## Execute like a business
_How_ to do _what_ needs to be done?



## The 4 Disciplines of Execution
* "Disciplines" for helping companies succesfully implement high-level strategies
* Also applicable to the quest to spend more time working deeply!


## Discipline #1: Focus on the Wildly Important
* "The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish."
* Identify your wildly important and exciting goals, and let those ambitious goals drive focused behavior


## Discipline #2: Act on the Lead Measures
* _Lag_ measures describe the thing you're trying to improve.
* _Lead_ measures, on the other hand, measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures.
* In other words, turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals.
* **For deep work**: track hours spent working deeply instead of your eventual output.


## Discipline #3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard
* "People play differently when they're keeping score."
* In a team, creates a sense of competition and provides a source of motivation.
* **For deep work**: Could be as simple as a physical tally of your current deep work hour count.


## Discipline #4: Create a Cadence of Accountability
* In a team, regular and frequent meetings to confront their scoreboard, commit to specific next actions, and describe what happened since the last meeting maintain a focus on lead measures.
* **For deep work**: Do weekly reviews, plan for workweek ahead.



## Downtime is important, too!
* It aids insights.
* It recharges the energy needed to work deeply.
* The work replaced by evening downtime is usually not that important.



## Rule #2: Embrace boredom



The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.

Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don’t simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction.



## Don't take breaks from distraction, take breaks from focus
* Schedule in advance when you'll use the Internet (i.e., give in to distractions), and then avoid it altogether outside those times.
* Constant switching from low-stimuli/high-value activities to high-stimuli/low-value activities at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty.
* By segregating distractions, you strengthen your mental attention-selecting muscles.



## Work like Teddy Roosevelt
The amount of time he spent at his desk was comparatively small, but his concentration was so intense that he could afford more time off [from schoolwork] than most.


## Roosevelt dashes
* Occasionally work like Roosevelt: give yourself a very hard deadline (drastically reduced from your normal estimate) for a deep task.
* Leverage artificial deadlines to help you systematically increase the level of concentration you can regularly achieve.



## Meditate productively
* Use downtime like walking, jogging, driving, showering to focus on a single well-defined professional problem.
* Beware of distractions and looping.
* Structure your deep thinking:
  * identify the relevant _variables_
  * identify the _next-step question_ using these variables
  * _consolidate_ your gains by reviewing the answer
  * then start over with the next question



## Rule #3: Quit social media
* Network tools and social media are diversions that steal your time and attention.


## Rule #4: Drain the shallows
